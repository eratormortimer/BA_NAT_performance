\section{Goals of the thesis}

This section describes the goals of this thesis (the goal should be a 1.0 grade,
but since that goal is quite implicit it can be omitted).

\section{Outline}

The thesis is structured as follows. In Chapter~\ref{chap:test} we will
describe awesome stuff in shiny fonts. Finally, the thesis is concluded in
Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} where we summarize our findings.
