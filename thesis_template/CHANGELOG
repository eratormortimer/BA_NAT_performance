1) We abandoned tikzexternalize since it causes more problems than it solves.
Instead there all TiKz figures should go into ./figures/<filename>.tikz and use
the standalone document class (see ./figures/test.tikz for an example). A
subordinate Makefile compiles all figures. If you supply -j <threads>, it will
also compile figures in parallel.
Due to this change it is more important than ever that you include all
additional packages in ./pream/Packages.tex, since this file is included by all
figures in order to get consistent fonts etc.

2) There is currently a known bug ./pream/MathConfiguration.tex (see FIXME). The
temporary fix is to comment the offending package, which is done by default.

1) All sty-files are stored in the package folder.
2) The Makefile in figures did not work for me, so I modified it a little. The
pream and packages folder is now copied into the figures subfolder.
3) I was unable to install the IEEtrans packet from my system reposiory, so I
put the files in the package folder.
4) For easy installation, here is a list of packages, I had to install:
	textlive-subfiles, texlive-libertine, textlive-newtx, texlive-mathalfa,
	texlive-makeshape, texlive-pgfplots, textlive-standalone,
