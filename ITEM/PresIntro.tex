\section{Performance Analysis of Middlebox Functionality}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Approach}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Selection of middlebox implementations} $\newline$ Review existing middlebox implementations and select candidates for testing
\item \textbf{Performance testing} $\newline$ Implement tests with good traffic in the testbed. Parameters to measure: throughput, latency, and power consumption. 
\item \textbf{Measurement evaluation and modeling} $\newline$ Analyse results and find models to explain them

\end{itemize}


\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Current status}

\begin{itemize}

\item Selection of best middlebox implementation
$\newline$
\item Current candidates for testing: 
$\newline$
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ClickOS} :
$\newline$
virtualized operating system to run Click-based middleboxes
$\newline$
\item \textbf{mOS}
$\newline$
expendable networking stack 
\end{itemize}


$\newline$
\item Goal: Extend-able and fast middlebox

\end{itemize}
